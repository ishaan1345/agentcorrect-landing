# Push AgentCorrect to GitHub

## Quick Steps to Create New Repo

### 1. Create repo on GitHub.com
Go to https://github.com/new and create a new repository:
- Name: `agentcorrect`
- Description: `CI/CD guardrails that prevent AI agents from charging customers twice. Catches missing Stripe idempotency, SQL without WHERE, Redis FLUSHALL. Exit code 2 blocks bad deploys.`
- Public repository
- DO NOT initialize with README (we have one)

### 2. Push this code
```bash
# Remove old remote
git remote remove origin

# Add your new repo (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agentcorrect.git

# Push to new repo
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages for landing page
1. Go to Settings â†’ Pages
2. Source: Deploy from branch
3. Branch: main
4. Folder: /docs
5. Save

### 4. Configure DNS for agentcorrect.com
Add these DNS records at your domain provider:

```

Type: A    Name: @    Value: 185.199.111.153
